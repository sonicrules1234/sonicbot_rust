Run sonicbot_rust once to generate a blank config file named conf.json.  Then fill out the config file and run sonicbot_rust again.  The location of the config file on android is sdcard/Android/data/rust.sonicbot/conf.json

Note: If you are upgrading from version 0.1.2, you need to add the hostlabel key and a value to go with it to your conf.json.
